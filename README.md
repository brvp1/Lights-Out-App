# Lights Out App

Lights Out is an Android (Java) Application.
The purpose of the game is to turn all the lights out (turn all the squares black) by tapping in the squares. 

Each tap turns the lights on or off in the square which is tapped as well as the orthogonally adjacent squares. 
The New Game button randomly resets each square to on or off.

Another page displays game instructions, and the user can also choose among different grid colors like red, yellow, orange, and green.
